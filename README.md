# Smart Fan Control System
The smart fan control system prototype is a sophisticated electronic device that has been designed to control the speed and direction of a DC motor-powered fan using an STM32 microcontroller and a potentiometer. The system's key objective is to provide users with a convenient and efficient means of regulating the airflow and temperature of a room through the manipulation of the fan's speed.
